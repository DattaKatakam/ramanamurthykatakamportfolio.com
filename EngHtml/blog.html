                    <p>My journey at <strong>Forvia Hella</strong> (May 2024 - March 2025) was transformative, working as both an intern and thesis student in Lippstadt. This 11-month experience shaped my understanding of professional software development and real-world problem solving.</p>
                    
                    <p>I designed and deployed advanced software solutions to automate vibration analysis workflows. My <strong>High-Speed Camera Image Acquisition Tool</strong> built with C++ and Qt integrated real-time zoom, exposure detection, and dynamic measurement visualization, reducing workflow time from 2 days to just 8 hours while eliminating reliance on third-party tools.</p>
                    
                    <p>The crown jewel was <strong>"Animator"</strong> – a comprehensive 3D motion visualization application that replaced costly tools like Hyper Mesh and Hyperview. With features like skeleton generation, tracking point selection, FRF analysis, and vibration flow analysis, it cut workflow time from 12+ hours to just 4 hours, saving significant licensing costs.</p>
                    
                    <p>This experience taught me the importance of user-centric design, multi-threaded architectures, and delivering polished solutions that drive efficiency across cross-functional teams.</p>

                <div class="blog-post-content">
                    <p>During my <strong>Research Assistant role</strong> (June-July 2025) at Juniorprofessur Werkstoffmechanik, I independently designed and developed a full-stack desktop application to control and monitor a concrete 3D printer in real time.</p>
                    
                    <p>The project involved building a <strong>digital twin of the printer using PyQt</strong> with MVC architecture for real-time visualization, control, and data acquisition. I implemented G-code injection, live sensor feedback, and operational control through a custom GUI.</p>
                    
                    <p>What made this project special was the complete development cycle – from design and implementation to testing and deployment. I used <strong>GitLab for agile development</strong>, tracked issues, created milestones, and packaged the application into standalone .exe files using PyInstaller for easy deployment.</p>
                    
                    <p>This experience reinforced my passion for creating intuitive, real-time control systems and demonstrated the power of digital twins in manufacturing applications.</p>

                    <p>From December 2022 to April 2025, I spent <strong>2.5 years as a C++ Research Assistant</strong> at Bauhaus-Universität Weimar, developing mathematical libraries and signal processing applications for research in numerical algorithms and real-time data processing.</p>
                    
                    <p>This role involved developing <strong>C++ libraries for solving linear and nonlinear equations</strong> and implementing machine learning algorithms like K-Means clustering and SVM. I designed Qt-based GUI applications for real-time data visualization and signal processing, making complex algorithms accessible to researchers.</p>
                    
                    <p>One of the most challenging aspects was <strong>optimizing algorithm performance</strong> for large-scale computations. I integrated advanced signal processing functions into research applications, improving data accuracy and processing speed. This work required deep understanding of both theoretical mathematics and practical software engineering.</p>
                    
                    <p>This long-term role taught me the importance of writing maintainable, well-documented code and how academic research can drive innovative software solutions. The experience laid a solid foundation for my current work in professional software development.</p>
